# Blaze
Programming language and interpreter. Sample code in test.bl

Weird stuff done for fun -

Function call format is foo(arg1, arg2, ...| arg42, arg43, ...)  
  where arg1, arg2 etc are passed by reference, and arg42, arg43, etc by value.  
No datatypes
  at least so far, and I intend to try to keep it that way. Chaos can be fun.

Done -

Making a scanner  
Making a parser  
Implementing namespaces  
Implementing functions  
Implementing assign and print library functions

To be done-
