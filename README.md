# Blaze
Programming language and interpreter. Sample code in test.bl

Weird stuff done for fun -

Function call format is foo(arg1, arg2, ...| arg42, arg43, ...)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where arg1, arg2 etc are passed by reference, and arg42, arg43, etc by value.  
No datatypes  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at least so far, and I intend to try to keep it that way. Chaos can be fun.
